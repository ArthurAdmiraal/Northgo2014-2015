================

Code for FTC team \(\Omega\)Voltz of the Northgo College in the year 2015. This code won the Fontys Control Award for the best software at FTC Dutch Open 2015.

The code on this repo consists of:
- The autonomous program
- The tele-operation program
- A library for driving omniwheels and keeping the robot orientation
- Other versions of the above programs that use the compass sensor instead of the gyroscope sensor. Please note that the versions for the gyroscope sensor contain the latest code.
- Various testing programs

Although I put this code up here under an open source license, I strongly discourage you to carbon copy it. I put the code on here so that people can learn from it, not so that they can forgo programming on their robot. You will learn a lot more if you program yourself, and the code will be much better suited to your robot. That being said, you have the right to modify and use this code, as long as you provide proper attribution. The best use case for this code would probably be to take this as a starting point and improve upon it. Please send us a message if you used this code, it is always nice hear that.

You can look at [my website](http://www.arthuradmiraal.nl/programming/ftc-taking-your-code-to-the-next-level/) for a post explaining some of the techniques used in this code.
